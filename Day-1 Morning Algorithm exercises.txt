Day-1 Morning Algorithm exercises
=================================

Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

-->
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should compute the sum using a loop and display the result.


Algorithm:
Start
Input a number n
Initialize a variable sum to 0
Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n:
Add the current number to sum
Display the value of sum
End


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Problem 2: Check for Prime Number

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.

-->
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Algorithm:
Start.
Input a number n
If n is less than 2, it is not a prime number
Use a loop to check divisibility from 2 to âˆšn:
If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number
If no divisors are found, n is a prime number
Display the result
End


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers

Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.

-->The user should input three values: a, b, and c.
The algorithm should compare the numbers and print the maximum value.

Algorithm:
Start
Input three numbers a, b, and c
Compare a and b to find the larger of the two
Compare the result with c to find the largest number
Display the maximum value
End

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 4: Factorial Calculation

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

-->
The user should input a number n.
The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to n.

Algorithm:
Start
Input a number n
Initialize a variable factorial to 1
Use a loop to multiply all integers from 1 to n:
factorial = factorial * i
Display the value of factorial
End

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

-->
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether n is divisible by 2 and display the result as either "Even" or "Odd".

Algorithm:
Start
Input a number n
Check if n is divisible by 2:
If yes, display "Even"
If no, display "Odd"
End
